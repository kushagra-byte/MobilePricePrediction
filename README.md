This project uses a deep neural network built with TensorFlow to predict the price range of mobile phones based on their hardware specifications. It consists of:

✅ Model training using a CSV dataset

🔍 Evaluation with metrics and visualizations

🧪 Inference on new/unseen phone specifications


Your dataset must be a CSV named dataset.csv.A sample is provided already

Installation:

Install dependencies with:
pip install tensorflow pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib

Training
To train the model:

run  mobile_price_predict.py

After model is trained and saved , run predict_price.py
